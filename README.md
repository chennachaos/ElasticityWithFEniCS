This repository contains source files (Python scripts) for solving elasticity problems using FEniCS library.

Some of the example problems solved are shown below.

# Linear and Hyperelasticity
## Linear elasticity


## Hyperelasticity

# Morphoelasticity - Growth-driven deformations

# Magnetomechanics
